### 🎨 Generative AI for Image Inpainting (MEng Thesis)

**Context:** MEng Research Project, Imperial College London

**Description:** This Master's thesis explored novel techniques for **text-conditioned image manipulation** by enhancing the object replacement and inpainting process using advanced segmentation and diffusion models.

* **Core Architectures:** The work involved exploring and benchmarking different **Diffusion Model architectures** to accurately fill masked regions of an image using contextual information.
* **Novel Methodology:** Developed and refined a novel methodology for improving GenAI image inpainting algorithms by integrating secondary AI mask generation.
* **Pipeline & Achievement:** Built a "find and replace" pipeline to segment objects using a text prompt, achieving **state-of-the-art visual coherence** for the inpainting process.

### 🧠 Masters Thesis (Future Focus)

**Institution:** Queen Mary University of London (Expected 2026)

**Description:** Currently specializing in **Multimodal AI** (Image, Audio, Language models) and Deep Learning Architectures, with a Predicted Classification of **1st (Distinction)**. The future project will focus on applied research within emerging Generative AI domains.

* **Target Area:** Aiming to undertake a project involving state-of-the-art **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** or complex **Computer Vision** tasks.

### 📊 High-Impact Fraud Detection Model

**Context:** Personal Project (Kaggle Dataset)

**Description:** Developed and rigorously optimized a financial fraud detection system, focusing on maximizing the capture rate of high-cost fraud cases (minimizing False Negatives) in a severely imbalanced credit card fraud dataset.

* **Model Architecture:** Built and optimized an **XGBoost** classifier, chosen for its speed, interpretability, and robust performance on tabular data.
* **Strategic Optimization:** Optimized the model for the **F-beta score ($\beta=20$)**—a metric explicitly weighting **Recall** over Precision—to heavily penalize high-cost false negatives.
* **Metric Achievement:** Achieved an exceptional **Recall of 95.7%** (catching 44 out of 46 fraud cases) by strategically shifting the classification threshold to **0.0035**. This result prioritized **loss prevention** over minimizing false alarms, a necessary trade-off that resulted in a Precision of **4.6%**.

### 🗺️ Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) for Geophysical Imaging

**Context:** Kaggle & Yale/UNC-CH ML Competition

**Description:** Engineered a sophisticated machine learning solution for a complex geophysical imaging problem, demonstrating adaptability to large-scale scientific datasets.

* **Architecture & Techniques:** Utilized **deep learning (U-Net)** and signal processing techniques to invert seismic waveform data.
* **Data Handling:** Showcased proficiency in handling non-standard, large-scale scientific datasets.
* **Achievement:** Achieved a highly competitive result in a specialized domain, demonstrating strong problem-solving and technical adaptation skills.
