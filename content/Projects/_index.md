### [Masters Thesis](Imperial_College_Thesis.pdf) @ Imperial College London: Diffusion Models for Image Inpainting
- Initially trained a diffusion model with a large face dataset to generate faces.
- Built a find and replace pipeline to segment features/objects using a text prompt, and subsequently replaced that part of the image with another object using a text-conditioned diffusion model (stable diffusion).
- Used powerful segmentation models with gaussian blur on the mask to improve inpainting harmony.

### Masters Thesis @ Queen Mary University of London
- Currently in the selection process.
- Ideally I can do a project involving Vision Language Models or Computer Vision in general with GenAI.

### GPT-2 Clone
- Trained a GPT-2 clone from scratch with Pytorch and preprocessed the script of 'The Matrix' to use as training data.

### Fraud Detection Kaggle
- Built and optimised a decision tree ensemble model to predict fraud in credit card data. Optimised for Recall so more fraud cases (and also false positives) were detected.

### Kaggle Competitions
- Scored 99%+ on MNIST classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
